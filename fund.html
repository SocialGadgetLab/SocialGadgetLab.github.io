Activities include:</p><ul><li>recruiting founders to:<ul><li>work closely with Lab members to develop and grow products from 0-to-1</li><li>fully take over from 1-to-n</li><li>retain large majority of equity in their products</li><li>participate in the Lab if they wish</li></ul></li><li>making traditional investments where appropriate</li></ul><p>The Fund has not launched yet - we will raise soon after the Lab is established.</p><b>Why not fund the Lab with management fees?</b><p>We believe 2% is an inappropriate budget for public goods. We do hope that in the long-term, the Fund’s performance fees and proprietary capital will be enough to sustain the Lab (given a 10-year fund lifecycle, we expect the Lab to rely on donations for at least 5 years). However, we believe that the dual structure will continue to align us with the mission - for profits to serve research, not for research to serve profits.</p><p>In particular, the Lab will not be bound by any KPIs/OKRs related to Fund performance.</p></main></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/fund","query":{},"buildId":"4WfNJ-I2EmzIAVhGZMT5D","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
